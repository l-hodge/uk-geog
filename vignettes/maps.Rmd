`ukgeog` provides several `read` functions to provide the ability to easily download official spatial data sets of the UK as simple feature (`sf`) objects. A full list of the geographies available is provided [here](https://l-hodge.github.io/uk-geog/). Here we demonstrate how this makes it easy to make choropleth maps with base R, as well as with popular packages such as `ggplot2`, `tmap` and `leaflet.`

First we need to read in a spatial dataset as a simple feature (`sf`), here we choose to make use of `read_admin` to read in the countries that make up the UK:
```{r getsf, eval = TRUE}
library(ukgeog)

sf <- read_admin("NAT")
```

Note: ` crs = 4326 ` (the default) provides the most capatibility with other functions

## Drawing maps with your simple feature

### -plot-

```{r plotexample, eval = TRUE}
plot(sf$geometry)
```

### -ggplot2-

```{r ggplotexample, eval = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(sf) + 
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void()
```

### -tmap-

```{r tmapexample, eval = TRUE}
library(tmap)

qtm(sf)
```

### -leaflet-

```{r leafletexample, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

leaflet(sf) %>% 
  addPolygons()
```

```{r saveleafletexample, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)

mapshot(leaflet(sf) %>% addPolygons(), 
        file = './leaflet.png')

#![](leaflet.png){width=400px}

```
